# How Tap Empire Works - Simple Explanation

## The Restaurant Analogy 🍕

Think of your game like a **pizza restaurant**:

### 1. The Restaurant (Frontend)
- **Location**: `https://playbitblast.com/tap-empire/`
- **What it is**: The actual restaurant where customers sit and eat
- **Built with**: React (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **What it does**: Shows the game interface, handles tapping, displays coins

### 2. The Kitchen (Backend Server)
- **Location**: Currently your computer (`localhost:3005`), needs to move online
- **What it is**: The kitchen where all the cooking (game logic) happens
- **Built with**: Node.js + Express
- **What it does**: 
  - Processes taps ("cook the orders")
  - Calculates coins and upgrades
  - Prevents cheating ("quality control")
  - Manages real-time features

### 3. The Recipe Book (MySQL Database)
- **Location**: Hostinger (`srv869.hstgr.io`)
- **What it is**: The permanent recipe book that never gets lost
- **Stores**: 
  - User accounts ("customer profiles")
  - Coin balances ("loyalty points")
  - Upgrades purchased ("favorite orders")
  - Game progress ("dining history")

### 4. The Order Board (Redis Cache)
- **Location**: Upstash (`engaging-poodle-47608.upstash.io`)
- **What it is**: The whiteboard showing current orders and live info
- **Stores**:
  - Live leaderboards ("today's top customers")
  - Active sessions ("who's currently dining")
  - Rate limiting ("prevent order spam")
  - Real-time events ("daily specials")

## How They Work Together

1. **Customer visits restaurant** → User opens `playbitblast.com/tap-empire/`
2. **Customer orders food** → User taps the button
3. **Order goes to kitchen** → Frontend sends request to backend server
4. **Kitchen checks recipe book** → Server queries MySQL for user data
5. **Kitchen updates order board** → Server updates Redis with live data
6. **Kitchen sends food back** → Server responds with updated coins
7. **Customer enjoys meal** → User sees new coin balance

## Current Problem 🚨

**The kitchen is in your house!** 

Your backend server is running on your personal computer (`localhost:3005`). When people visit your restaurant online, they can't reach the kitchen because it's not connected to the internet.

## Solution 🎯

**Move the kitchen to a commercial space!**

Deploy your backend server to Railway (or another hosting service) so it gets a public address like `https://your-app.railway.app`. Then:

- ✅ Restaurant (frontend) stays at `playbitblast.com/tap-empire/`
- ✅ Kitchen (backend) moves to `your-app.railway.app`
- ✅ Recipe book (MySQL) stays at Hostinger
- ✅ Order board (Redis) stays at Upstash

## File Structure Explained

```
My first game/
├── client/          # The Restaurant (Frontend)
│   ├── src/         # Restaurant layout and decorations
│   └── build/       # Ready-to-serve restaurant files
├── server/          # The Kitchen (Backend)
│   ├── src/         # Kitchen equipment and recipes
│   └── .env         # Kitchen's address book (database connections)
├── database/        # Recipe templates
└── docs/           # This explanation file
```

## Environment Variables (.env file)

Think of this as the kitchen's **address book**:

- `DB_HOST` = Recipe book location (Hostinger)
- `REDIS_URL` = Order board location (Upstash)  
- `PORT` = Kitchen's phone number (3005)
- `CORS_ORIGIN` = Which restaurants can call the kitchen

## When You Get Confused Later 🤔

Remember: **You have ONE game with FOUR parts**

1. **Frontend** = What players see and click
2. **Backend** = Game logic and rules  
3. **MySQL** = Permanent storage (save files)
4. **Redis** = Temporary fast storage (live data)

The frontend talks to the backend, the backend talks to both databases. It's like a chain: Frontend → Backend → Databases

## Next Steps

1. Deploy backend server to Railway
2. Update frontend to point to new server URL
3. Test everything works
4. Celebrate! 🎉
